An interactive JavaScript simulation that demonstrates the principles of **evolution by natural selection** using the classic example of **peppered moths**. Observe how camouflage, predation, mutation, and environmental change shape populations over generations!

## ðŸŒ± Features

-  **Background slider** to simulate environmental change (tree color)
-  Randomly generated moths with light or dark coloration
-  **Timed generations** (10 seconds each)
-  **Natural selection**: moths that stand out get eaten
-  **Reproduction** with certain mutation chance
-  **Population graph** to visualize changes in traits over time
-  **Predator Mode**: manually remove visible moths by clicking
-  **Reset button** to restart the simulation at any time

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript
- No libraries or frameworks required

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Use the controls to:
   - Adjust tree color with the slider
   - Toggle Predator Mode and click moths to "hunt"
   - Observe the population evolve over time!
   - Reset to restart with a fresh population

## ðŸ“š Concepts Demonstrated

- **Random variation** (moths are born with random traits)
- **Selective pressure** (background color affects visibility)
- **Natural selection** (visible moths are more likely to be removed)
- **Mutation** (new traits can appear even without parent influence)
- **Evolution over generations**

## ðŸ§  Inspiration

Inspired by the real-life case of **peppered moths during the Industrial Revolution**, where pollution darkened tree bark and favored dark-colored moths for survival.
